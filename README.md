## **Inspiration:**

We are planning on making investment planning software. 
Software for planning things contributes to happiness by helping organize your life and taking away from chaos. 
The software will implement statistical and graph algorithms to decide how to allocate money to invest into assets. 
We will use Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm to find correlations between different stocks using clustering methods and edge distance between nodes which will represent different stocks. 
The analysis will show if stocks are positively or negatively correlated and if there groups of assets that behave similarly.
An investor can use the information given to diversify their portfolios and minimize risk of losses by having all eggs in one basket.
